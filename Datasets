Data plays an important role in machine learning, without proper data we cannot train any machine learning algorithms and cannot predict outcomes. Data is used to improve machine learning algorithms to continuously operate efficiently. For the model to perform efficiently, training data is used to train a model for predictions and test data is used to make sure that the model is trained correctly.

Data preprocessing is the process in which the data is transformed to such a state where all the features can be easily interpreted by the model. Data preprocessing is an essential part of machine learning workflow as we obtain clean valid data to train the model. Data preprocessing involves normalizing data, looking for missing values and imputing them, splitting the data into training, and testing data for the machine learning model.

The Data Normalization process involves transforming the data to a specific range to reduce the bias due to huge differences in the range of features. Data normalization is used by the algorithms which compute the distance between data points. In this paper, the Min-Max scaler is used to normalize the data which the values are rescaled to the range of 0 and 1 allotting zero to the least data value and one to the highest, and all the other values with decimal values between 0 and 1. This technique has the advantage that it rescues the data without disturbing the relationship between the data points.

Missing values are generally represented by NaN (Not a Number) or with a question mark (?), The machine learning model can give accurate predictions only if it has unbiased data. To deal with missing values kNN imputation method is used in this paper. The kNN imputer fills out the missing values in the datasets by using the Euclidian distance metric
